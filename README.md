# Image_Palette_Generator
Upload an image and generate a custom palette based on the 5 most prevalent colors. 

This GUI-based image palette-generator uses python, tkinter, PILLOW, OpenCV, collections, sklearn, and pyperclip. It's fairly simple in operation. Choose a photo to pull a color theme from. Then click "Generate Palette". Using clustering and K-Means, the algorithm contained within will find the 5 most prevalent colors in an image and generate a palette. Pyperclip will allow you to copy the hexadecimal color code to your computer's clipboard after you click on the hex code button. 

GUI design by yours truly. Steal or destroy at will. Fonts used are: Impact Label and Impact Label Reversed by Tension Type (mtension@gmail.com for paypal support!).
